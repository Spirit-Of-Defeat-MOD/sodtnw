# Scripted AI desire for peace actions. This affects AI behavior but not the cost.

# *** How to access data from the peace action ***
# ROOT - Negotiator country (who is doing the negotiation)
# FROM - Taker country (who will be the owner after the conference)
# FROM.FROM - Giver country (who was the owner before the conference)
# FROM.FROM.FROM - State (iff peace action refers to a state)
# You might have to use e.g. ROOT.FROM to access the variable from inside another scope

# Possible peace action types
# - take_states
# - puppet
# - force_government
# - liberate
