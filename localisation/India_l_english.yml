india.1.t:0 "British India Introduction"
india.1.d:0 "The 'Crown Jewel of the Empire', India is without a doubt Britain's most important colonial holding. Textiles, spices, soldiers, and much more flow to the British Isles from the subcontinent. Tensions between the colonial authorities and their subjects have been rising in recent years - an underccurent of calls for independence is brewing amongst the general populace. Authority figures in India have also begun to distrust London, and have been scheming behind closed doors to advance their own interests. As the rift between the British Empire, Indian authorities, and the general populace grows wider - the need for a drastic change in approach seems to be all but inevitable."

indian_coup.1.t:0 "The Dyer Coup"
indian_coup.1.d:0 "On the morning of November 11th, retired Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer and several Sikh troops who defected have seized government buildings, fired upon crowds of civilians, and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence. Colonel Dyer has proclaimed himself as the chief exececutive of New Punjab under the guise that only he could serve as a 'strong hand' to 'be exerted against malice and perversion of good order.' He decried the British authorities as weak, incompetant, and corrupted. The British government has condemned the coup, calling the act treasonous and referring to Dyer as a terrorist and an extremist."
indian_coup.1.a:0 "These Are Dire Circumstances..."
indian_coup.2.t:0 "A Stroke of Luck"
indian_coup.2.d:0 "In a stroke of luck for the British, Colonel Dyer has passed away from a stroke a mere three days after his attempted coup. Worldwide, the colonel faced condemnation for his brutality against dissidents and his unlawful attempt at establishing his own dictatorial fiefdom. Despite his passing, the aftershocks of his actions are being felt across India. The general populace has only grown angrier, and British control over India has been significantly weakened and delegitimized."
