#Leaders
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DESC:0 "After being pressured to take the Albanian throne in 1913, Prince William of Wied (Vidi I or Skanderberg II) now resides over a politically unstable and turbulent state. After compromising with Ahmet Muhtar Zogolli to end the 1925 coup he is all now but a ruler in name as Zog and his inner circle now control the nation in a dictatorship."

#should be reintegrated
ALB_modernize_albania:0 "Modernize Albania"
ALB_modernize_albania_desc:0 "400 years of Ottoman rule has left the Albanian state semi-feudal and backwards. Despite our independence in 1912 we have failed to catch up with our neighbours. It is urgent that we do or Albania will become subject to another foreign ruler very soon."
