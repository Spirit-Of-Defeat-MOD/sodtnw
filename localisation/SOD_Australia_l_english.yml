australia.1.t:0 "Out in the country..."
australia.1.d:0 "It was supposed to be a regular morning for *REDACTED* on the *REDACTED* in *REDACTED*, Australia. That was, until he saw the emus.\n\nOut of nowhere, large flocks of these birds came charging straight at his paddock and stormed the fence. In a panic, he called for his wife for the rifle, but by the time his gun was given and he ran to the field in a panic, 'twas too late. All but a few clumps of his crops remained, the others having been consumed by the emus. Several other reported cases of emu infestation and invasion have been reported in other parts of the outback.\n\nConsidering how we lost the First Emu War, the government is split 50/50 on whether to intervene militarily. Some argue leaving the farmers to deal with the birds is the better choice, while others say that having learnt from misakes of the first war, we can avoid them, and win against the emus. The latter option will cull the emu threat faster, but we risk wasting resources should we fail."
