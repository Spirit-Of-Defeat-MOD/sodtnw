CHL_fascism_party_long:0 "Movimiento Nacional Socialista de Chile\n§gLed by Jorge Gonzalez von Marees since the party's inception in 1932, the Movimiento Nacional Socialista de Chile (or Nacis for short) has been the leading far-right party of the Socialist Republic of Chile. The party's ideology, National Socialism, is an offshoot of the original National Syndicalist ideology from Italy. National Socialism follows a much more unorthodox rhetoric than its father ideology, stressing extreme anti-Semitism, one party totalitarian rule and corporatism. During the first few years of the party's existence, they recieved much attention from the German community of Chile and from the Italian government, who both gave them funding and arms for their own paramilitary wing. As of now, they are 20,000 members strong, and that statistic is growing by the day.§!"
