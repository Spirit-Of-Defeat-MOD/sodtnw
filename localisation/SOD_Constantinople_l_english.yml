KON_TE_LAWRENCE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!\n16 August, 1888\nTremadog, Carnarvonshire, Wales\n\nSir Thomas Edward Lawrence VC has lived a very eventful life, to say the least. A praised military genius and renowned archaeologist, Thomas was born out of wedlock at his family home in Wales, as the second of five sons. Educated at Oxford Boys High School and Jesus College, he worked as an archaeologist for the British Museum before the Great War began. During that war, Thomas signed up for service in the British Army, and was stationed in Egypt, before becoming involved in the Arab Revolt as a liaison to King Faisal’s forces. In the Middle East his skills as a military commander were shown; The Ottoman-controlled port of Aqaba fell in a raid, and Damascus fell to Lawrence’s men later in the war.\n\nLawrence joined the Foreign Office after the war, working with the British government and with King Faisal. He also began to write his memoirs of his time in Arabia, his first being published in 1926, titled Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Lawrence experiences both amazed and shocked the world, bringing to light a forgotten part of the war. Being able to so vividly recount his memories, from the Battle of Aqaba in 1917, to his meetings with Emir Faisal and the Capture of Damascus in 1918 earned him international fame and the nickname Lawrence of Arabia. It was around this time in 1926 that Lawrence was awarded the Victoria Cross and granted knighthood, and also when the Third Balkan War took place. After the war, the International Straits Zone was set up as a British Mandate in the Constantinople region, and T.E. Lawrence was elected as the mandate’s first governor."
POLITICS_WINSTON_CHURCHILL_DESC:0 "Despite his blunders at Gallipoli and on the Western Front, his horrible mismanagement of the Gold Coast Colony and his resulting political isolation soon after, Winston Churchill has somehow managed to make his way up to the top, this time as the modest governor of the International Straits Zone. Although his incompetence at governing colonies had been shown exceptionally with his time at the Gold Coast, after the death of the region’s previous governor, T.E. Lawrence in a motorbike accident at his home in 1935, the council was at a loss. There was no man who wanted to be involved in any affairs of the Straits Zone, where tensions were high and headaches and migraines were all too common.\n\nBut there was one offer.\n\nThe only man to put his hat in the ring was none other than the despised man himself, Winston Churchill. Having been kicked from all ministerial positions months prior he found himself a lost man, spending his days at his residence; Blenheim Palace. With nothing to lose, he thought to himself, he offered to be the governor of this godforsaken land.\n\nBorn to a aristocratic family in Oxfordshire, Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill lived a pompous and elegant childhood. With his enlistment in the Royal Army in 1895 followed action across the empire, culminating with him overseeing the command of the Gallipoli campaign in the Great War; the latter of which proved to be the greatest military disaster in history. His reputation came crumbling down soon after. Seeking to restore it, he joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers, where he experienced the horrors of continuous artillery barrages and poor foodstuffs. The war ended, and he returned to his isle, and he found himself hated; exiled by his fellow countrymen due to his horrible blunder at Gallipoli. Then a few years later, by pure chance, Churchill was chosen at random as the governor of the Gold Coast Colony - which his horrible mismanagement of caused a protest, a riot, a revolt and then a dismissal. Then Churchill slid into the shadows for the next few years of his life, and, before his eyes, witnessed the stripping of all his positions in the government he still held.\n\nAt first, when the council received his offer, they almost immediately denied it, but they thought reasonably; a governor, or no governor at all? Though reluctantly, they accepted his offer. He was approved by George V and was sent to Constantinople, where he stands now. 20 years after he has returned to where his ‘folly’ took place. But the question remains, can Churchill retain his reputation once more, or will he live the rest of his life a detested man?"
