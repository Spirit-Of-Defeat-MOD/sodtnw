POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!\n16 August, 1888\nTremadog, Carnarvonshire, Wales\n\nSir Thomas Edward Lawrence VC has lived a very eventful life, to say the least. A praised military genius and renowned archaeologist, Thomas was born out of wedlock at his family home in Wales, as the second of five sons. Educated at Oxford Boys High School and Jesus College, he worked as an archaeologist for the British Museum before the Great War began. During that war, Thomas signed up for service in the British Army, and was stationed in Egypt, before becoming involved in the Arab Revolt as a liaison to King Faisal’s forces. In the Middle East his skills as a military commander were shown; The Ottoman-controlled port of Aqaba fell in a raid, and Damascus fell to Lawrence’s men later in the war.\n\nLawrence joined the Foreign Office after the war, working with the British government and with King Faisal. He also began to write his memoirs of his time in Arabia, his first being published in 1926, titled Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Lawrence experiences both amazed and shocked the world, bringing to light a forgotten part of the war. Being able to so vividly recount his memories, from the Battle of Aqaba in 1917, to his meetings with Emir Faisal and the Capture of Damascus in 1918 earned him international fame and the nickname Lawrence of Arabia. It was around this time in 1926 that Lawrence was awarded the Victoria Cross and granted knighthood, and also when the Third Balkan War took place. After the war, the International Straits Zone was set up as a British Mandate in the Constantinople region, and T.E. Lawrence was elected as the mandate’s first governor."
