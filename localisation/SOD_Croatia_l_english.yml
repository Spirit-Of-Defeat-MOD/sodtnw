 croatia.2.d:0 "Established in the aftermath of the Third Balkan War, the Republic of Croatia has faced severe domestic and international tensions. Croatia was promised independence from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in a secret pact with Italian leader Luigi Federzoni. The Croatians were promised that they would no longer be subjugated by the government in Beograd, and members of the HSS reluctantly signed the agreement. Large numbers of Croats revolted against the Yugoslav government, as Italian troops began to flood into the nation.

Upon entering the camp in May, the Serbs came across only ruins, soot, smoke, and the skeletal remains of thousands of victims. 'This is just another proof of how brutal Croats are towards non-croatian civilians and jews', says the Serbian leader."
