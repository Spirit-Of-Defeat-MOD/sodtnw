#Parties
GER_fascism_party:0 "DAP"
GER_fascism_party_long:0 "Deutsche Arbeiterpartei \n§g Led by Gottfried Feder, the DAP is a militaristc and highly nationalistic party seeking to: restore Germany's greatness, unite the German people, and to defeat the 'reds' and capitalists in an all out war. Despite their extreme rhetoric, the DAP has soared in popularity since their establishment in the aftermath of the Great War.§!"
GER_communism_party:0 "KPD"
GER_communism_party_long:0 "Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands \n§g Adhering to strict Leninist thought, the KPD under Max Reimann's leadership has drifted closely towards the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the KPD have remained a divisive force, condemning the more moderate left wing parties such as the SPD for being 'social reactionaries.' With enemies on the left and right, the KPD appear cornered amongst hostile forces.§!"
GER_democratic_party:1 "DVP"
GER_democratic_party_long:0 "Deutsche Volkspartei \n§g Representing conservatives and national liberals, the DVP advocates for Christian family values, lower tariffs, decreased welfare spending and agricultural subsidies, and opposition to the Marxist communists and social democrats. Generally, the DVP tolerated the Republic, although fringe anti-democraticmembers did exist within the party.§!"
GER_utilitarian_despot_party:0 "Militärregierung"
GER_utilitarian_despot_party_long:0 "Reichswehr Militärregierung \n§g Headed by Hans von Seeckt, the Militärregierung is an authoritarian government that was established following the November Putsch against the Weimar government. Consisting mostly of 'Old Guard' conservatives, the junta is anti-democratic and a fierce proponent of remilitarization. The end goal of these generals is undoubtedly to restore the ''1914 Frontier'' that was stripped from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. Nonetheless, there remains division within the Oberste Heeresleitung regarding the course of action to take in order to restore Germany's territorial possessions.§!"
GER_neutrality_party:0 "DNVP"
GER_neutrality_party_long:0 "Deutschnationale Volkspartei \n§g Calling for the destruction of the Weimar government, the DNVP, headed by Alfred Hugenberg, is Germany's most popular right-wing party. Consisting of a coalition between monarchists and German nationalists, the party calls for the rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and the instatement of mandatory military conscription. Nonetheless, with the rise of the DAP and OC, their domination of the German right may come to an abrupt end.§!"
GER_social_democracy_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democracy_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \n§g Although being amongst the most popular parties in Germany, the SPD are surrounded by enemies. The far-left view them as 'social reactionaries' who have sold out to the bourgeoisie capitalists; the far-right view them as degenarate and dangerous communist sympathizers. Furthermore, the German Reichswehr ousted an SPD led coalition government in November of 1935. Powerless and persecuted, the SPD is in a precarious position.§!"
GER_classic_liberal_party:0 "Zentrum"
GER_classic_liberal_party_long:0 "Deutsche Zentrumspartei \n§g Taking part in most of the coalitions during the Weimar period, Zentrum is a pragmatic and moderate party with a focus on promoting Catholic interests in Germany. They are willing to work with the left and the right, and have some within their ranks who are willing to cooperate with the monarchists. As such, Zentrum is a party of compromise and cooperation, relying on working with the other parties to get things accomplished.§!"
GER_social_liberal_party:0 "DDP"
GER_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Deutsche Demokratische Partei \n§g Supporting the Weimar government and republican values, the DDP maintains moderate stances on most issues and seeks to preserve the democraticsystem that was established after the climax of the Great War.

GER_totalitarian_socialism_party:0 "Alte SPD"
GER_totalitarian_socialism_party_long:0 "Alte Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \n§g This radical offshoot of the SPD, under the direction of Ernst Niekisch, uphold a 'proletarian nationalist' ideology known as National Bolshevism. A blend of Marxist principles and extreme nationalism, Alte SPD dogma dictates the establishment of a totalitarian state that is capable of opposing the capitalists who've undermined Germany. The Alte SPD's socialism is quite distinct from that of the KPD or SPD; it focuses much more on militaristic and isolationist values rather than revolutionary internationalism.§!"
GER_revolutionary_socialism_party:0 "KAPD"
GER_revolutionary_socialism_party_long:0 "Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands \n§g Opposed to Leninist doctrine, left-communists led by Otto Rühle splintered from the KPD. They reject the institution of a one-party dictatorship and state capitalism in favor of council vanguard_communism, replacing democraticcentralism with workers' councils and soviet democracy. Rivalries between the KAPD and their Leninist counterparts have continued to flare up in the unstable political climate.§!"
GER_democratic_socialism_party:0 "SAPD"
GER_democratic_socialism_party_long:0 "Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands \n§g The SAPD, the democraticsocialist party, formed after a splintering of the SPD. They became affiliated with the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, an organization of left-socialists that rejected the Third International and mainstream social democraticideology. Their numbers are fairly small, although the persecution of the SPD following the November Putsch has led to an increase in SAPD membership.§!"
GER_nihilistic_extremism_party:0 "OC"
GER_nihilistic_extremism_party_long:0 "Organisation Consul \n§g A radical militant organization, the far-right paramilitary has been led by Heinrich Himmler since mid-1935. Himmler drastically reshaped the organization's platform, arguing that only embracing nihlism could redeem Germany's degeneracy; he avowed that everything, including life itself, is truly worthless. As such, the OC kill and torture with impunity in order to 'rid the world of decadence, degeneracy, and the filth of humanity' thus allowing them to fulfill their role as the ubermensch. Achieving the "ewiger kriegszustand" or eternal state of war, in which man is liberated of idleness and weakness is seen as the end goal of Himmler's twisted ideology. Ultimately, Himmler and his cult-like following seek domination and control.§!"

#Leaders
POLITICS_VON_SCHLEICHER_DESC:0 "A well respected figure within the Reichswehr, Kurt von Schleicher despised the republican government and sought to instate a nationalistic dictatorship - a stance embraced by most of the other Reichswehr officers and generals. With Hans von Seeckt's November Putsch, Schleicher's desire to see the republic crumble was granted. Nonetheless, Schleicher has become disillusioned with the 'Bolshevization' of Seeckt's regime. With Seeckt's age becoming apparent, Schleicher has come to recognize that an opportunity to steer Germany down a different path is soon to be opening. Schleicher is an opportunist and a staunch nationalist who will do whatever is necessary to restore Germany's greatness."
POLITICS_VON_SEECKT_DESC:0 "In the midst of chaos, Germany needed a strong leader to rise and save the nation from collapse. Hans von Seeckt aligned himself with the Bavarian triumvirate (Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Hans Ritter von Seisser, and Otto von Lossow) to crush the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch and restore order. With the feeble republic crumbling apart, Seeckt recognized that this would be the only opportunity to seize power and restructure Germany into a nation that could one-day reclaim its rightful lands. The Reichswehr occupied the Reichstag and declared the dissolution of the Weimar Republic. Hans von Seeckt single-handedly reformed the Reichswehr into a capable fighting force - in spite of the harsh restrictions imposed by the French and British. He strengthened ties between Germany and the Soviet Union and has vastly improved Germany's military readiness. His military expertise is unquestioned within the Reichswehr, although his fondness towards the Bolsheviks has made more reactionary generals uneasy."

#Ideas
rampant_paramilitaries:0 "Rampant Paramilitaries"
rampant_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Germany has been plagued with paramilitary violence since the end of the Great War. The Weimar government, seen as illegitimate by the far left and right, had failed to put an end to the issue. Since Seeckt's Putsch of '23, paramilitary activity has surged in popularity by a resurgence in radical factions. Until drastic action is taken, warfare comparable to that of the Great War will continue to occur in German streets."
black_reichswehr:0 "Black Reichswehr"
black_reichswehr_desc:0 "Formed in the period of the Weimar Republic, the Black Reichswehr is a group of paramilitary organisations free from any law or legislation. They are supported by the main army, the Reichswehr, as an auxiliary army used to circumvent restrictions imposed upon Germany's military by the Treaty of Versailles. The Black Reichswehr is a great asset to us and our army, and will surely prove useful in the event of a conflict."
economic_troubles:0 "Half-Crippled Economy"
economic_troubles_desc:0 "Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles stated that Germany, out of our allies, should accept most, if not full, responsibility for starting the First World War. The article also stated for us to pay reparations to the Allies for the damage caused. This, on top of a severely damaged industry, an unstable government and constant skirmishes with paramilitaries in the street that causes even more damage to infrastructure, makes it nearly impossible for us to rebuild our economy any time soon." 
sour_loser:0 "Bitter Loser"
sour_loser_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles humiliated the German nation, stripping us of everything we had ever worked for. We were so close... so close to achieving victory, so close to taking Paris, so close to taking Rome. If it wasn't those damn Allies that had shown up in France and those traitors who stabbed us in the back in the home front! We will not stand for this! Germany shall rise once again, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. We are that phoenix, and we will show them, we will take revenge! Our goal in the First World War was to crush the Allied powers, and that, as Gott as our witness, is what we will do, to finish what we started two decades prior! Gott Mit Uns!"
general_staff:0 "German General Staff"
general_staff_desc:0 "The German General Staff, officially the Great General Staff, is responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, whether it be sea or land or air. Some of what they do include the drafting and reviewing of plans for mobilization or campaign. This contributes to a higher level of organization and discipline in the army."
