 indochina.1.d:0 ""
 indochina.1.a:0 "Enough with these petty ramblings..."
 indochina.2.t:0 "A letter from the Colonial Office." 
 indochina.2.d:0 "A recent letter from a Colonial Offical in Hanoi has sent our Governor a proposal about a new capital for the federation. Hanoi recently has been overcrowded and the local citizens resist plans to improve and renovate the city to preserve its traditional style. The Offical has suggested 4 possibilities: \n\n1.Phu Xuan - The Nguyen Imperial City would be a good candidate for our new administrative centre. Expanding the ancient city around the citadel will not just help the slow modernization of the region but we will also be able to keep a closer watch on our colonial subjects. \n\n2. Da Lat - This is a very popular tourist destination, it has some of the best architechture in the colony. Despiet this it lacks any serious industry so it cannot be an industrial centre without some work.  \n\n3. Can Tho - Sitting at thr base of the Hau River. This Town provides us a very important strategic location and area to expand the local town. The Locals here are noted to be very friendly towards the colonial regime so we should have no issue expediting any plans we have. \n\n4. Hanoi - We can choose to stay in Hanoi and continue renovation as planned, this however won't sit well with the local populace and might cause issues in the future."

 indochina.3.t:0 "A Girl With A Secret"
 indochina.3.d:0 "Recent news have surfaced of a young woman, by the name of Do Thi Binh, who was recently drowned in a large body of water - in an act of pure hatred. The woman perished in the water and her body has yet to be discovered. \n\nShortly before the incident, a young poet of the name Nguyen Nhut Phap passed away, leaving behind his family and talents. His family of poets and other talented writers mourn his loss. The young man turned out to be deeply in love with the young lady and wrote many poems for her, It was revealed in these poems that Do Thi Binh was transgender! When the public had found out, they stormed her home and dragged her to the lake where they would drown her.\n\nThis act of pure violence and hatred cannot go unpunished, but the circumstances are certainly controversial. \n\nIf we are to ignore this matter and push it under the rug, the world may hear of this and condemn our great nation as corrupt and inhumane. If we deal with the mob members involved, the public will surely not approve, although the family would be quite grateful. \n\nThe choice is yours."
