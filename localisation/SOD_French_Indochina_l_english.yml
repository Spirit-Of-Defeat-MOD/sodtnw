indochina.2.t:0 "A letter from the Colonial Office." 
indochina.2.d:0 "A recent letter from a Colonial Offical in Hanoi has sent our Governor a proposal about a new capital for the federation. Hanoi recently has been overcrowded and the local citizens resist plans to improve and renovate the city to preserve its traditional style. The Offical has suggested 4 possibilities: \n\n1.Phu Xuan - The Nguyen Imperial City would be a good candidate for our new administrative centre. Expanding the ancient city around the citadel will not just help the slow modernization of the region but we will also be able to keep a closer watch on our colonial subjects. \n\n2. Da Lat - This is a very popular tourist destination, it has some of the best architechture in the colony. Despiet this it lacks any serious industry so it cannot be an industrial centre without some work.  \n\n3. Can Tho - Sitting at thr base of the Hau River. This Town provides us a very important strategic location and area to expand the local town. The Locals here are noted to be very friendly towards the colonial regime so we should have no issue expediting any plans we have. \n\n4. Hanoi - We can choose to stay in Hanoi and continue renovation as planned, this however won't sit well with the local populace and might cause issues in the future."

indochina.3.d:0 "Recent news has surfaced of a young woman, by the name of Do Thi Binh, who was recently drowned in a large body of water - in an act of pure hatred. The woman perished in the water and her body has yet to be discovered. \n\nShortly before the incident, a young poet of the name Nguyen Nhut Phap passed away, leaving behind his family and talents. His family of poets and other talented writers mourn his loss. The young man turned out to be deeply in love with the young lady and wrote many poems for her, It was revealed in these poems that Do Thi Binh was transgender! When the public had found out, they stormed her home and dragged her to the lake where they would drown her.\n\nThis act of pure violence and hatred cannot go unpunished, but the circumstances are certainly controversial. \n\nIf we are to ignore this matter and push it under the rug, the world may hear of this and condemn our great nation as corrupt and inhumane. If we deal with the mob members involved, the public will surely not approve, although the family would be quite grateful. \n\nThe choice is yours."

indochina.5.t:0 "A Revolt in Cho Lon"
indochina.5.d:0 "The purpose of the meeting today between the governor of the colony and Phan Chau Trinh, the leader of the radical independence group ‘the Indochinese League of Freedom’ was meant to cool heightened tensions between the revolutionaries and the government, but it has had seemingly the opposite effect. This morning at the strike of dawn, Phan Chau Trinh, surrounded by several bodyguards greeted the governor at the steps of the Governor’s Residence in Phu Xuan. After an hour of tea-sipping and conversation of miscellaneous subjects, talks on the subject they met for began. After a tense hour of back and forth conversation, and pleading and reason and compromise, Phan Chau Trinh suddenly stood up and exited the room, to the shock of the governor. As he walked through the hall, several ministers attempted to ask what had happened, but he replied by shouting Indochinese independence slogans. Outside, at the building’s entrance, several reporters and photographers swarmed him with questions on whether an agreement had been made. His reply, a short but effective speech denouncing the French colonial government and calling for a revolution - something that which he, known for his peaceful nature, would never have said -  shocked the crowd. He continued, stating that if his requests, now demands, could not be met, there would be ‘no other option’. He then abruptly moved to board his car, leaving the reporters behind. A few hours later, colonial police were called into the city square. Several members of the same group led by Phan Chau Trinh had been reported to have stormed several key locations in the city, some of these being the Imperial Palace, the radio station and the local military barracks, and were advancing quickly towards the Colonial Parliament. However, many of the soldiers and police called for the hasty defence of the parliament refused to do so as many of them were sympathetic to the revolutionary cause. Many of the troops and several high ranking officers defected to the revolutionary side, and rebel and soldier marched arm in arm to the parliament building. After a tense standoff, the several ministers taking refuge inside of the building surrendered to the revolutionaries, where they were shoved into trucks and then driven to an unknown location. The rebels then declared the establishment of the Provisional Council of Free Indochina and as well the Indochinese Declaration of Independence -  a hastily written document authored by three revolutionary delegates. Then, the independence declaration was read aloud by Phan Chau Trinh himself over the radio to over a million listeners, who he asked for them to take up arms against the government. By this time the governor of the colony had long evacuated the city south to the loyalist city of Dalat, declaring the government based there. But at the same time, the cities of Cho Lon, Vinh, and Can Tho had been secured under rebel control, and Hanoi was under siege by advancing revolutionary forces. The Indochinese War of Independence begins!"
