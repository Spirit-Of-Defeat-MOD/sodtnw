Despite their extreme rhetoric, the DAP has soared in popularity since their establishment in the aftermath of the Great War.§!"
GER_communism_party:0 "KPD"
GER_communism_party_long:0 "Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands \n\n\n\n\n\n£kpd\n\n\n\n\n\n \n§g Adhering to strict Leninist thought, the KPD under Max Reimann's leadership has drifted closely towards the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the KPD have remained a divisive force, condemning the more moderate left wing parties such as the SPD for being 'social reactionaries.' With enemies on the left and right, the KPD appear cornered amongst hostile forces.§!"
GER_democratic_party:1 "Zentrum"
GER_democratic_party_long:0 "Deutsche Zentrumspartei \n§g Taking part in most of the coalitions during the Weimar period, Zentrum is a pragmatic and moderate party with a focus on promoting Catholic interests in Germany.

GER_utilitarian_despot_party_long:0 "Reichswehr Militärregierung \n\n\n\n\n\n£grw\n\n\n\n\n\n \n§g Headed by Hans von Seeckt, the Militärregierung is an authoritarian government that was established following the November Putsch against the Weimar government. Consisting mostly of 'Old Guard' conservatives, the junta is anti-democratic and a fierce proponent of remilitarization. The end goal of these generals is undoubtedly to restore the ''1914 Frontier'' that was stripped from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. Nonetheless, there remains division within the Oberste Heeresleitung regarding the course of action to take in order to restore Germany's territorial possessions.§!"

Consisting of a coalition between monarchists and German nationalists, the party calls for the rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and the instatement of mandatory military conscription. Nonetheless, with the rise of the DAP and OC, their domination of the German right may come to an abrupt end.§!"
GER_social_democracy_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democracy_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \n§g Although being amongst the most popular parties in Germany, the SPD are surrounded by enemies. The far-left view them as 'social reactionaries' who have sold out to the bourgeoisie capitalists; the far-right view them as degenarate and dangerous communist sympathizers. Furthermore, the German Reichswehr ousted an SPD led coalition government in November of 1935. Powerless and persecuted, the SPD is in a precarious position.§!"

GER_totalitarian_socialism_party_long:0 "Alte Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \n§g This radical offshoot of the SPD, under the direction of Ernst Niekisch, uphold a 'proletarian nationalist' ideology known as National Bolshevism. A blend of Marxist principles and extreme nationalism, Alte SPD dogma dictates the establishment of a totalitarian state that is capable of opposing the capitalists who've undermined Germany. The Alte SPD's socialism is quite distinct from that of the KPD or SPD; it focuses much more on militaristic and isolationist values rather than revolutionary internationalism.§!"
GER_revolutionary_socialism_party:0 "KAPD"
GER_revolutionary_socialism_party_long:0 "Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands \n§g Opposed to Leninist doctrine, left-communists led by Otto Rühle splintered from the KPD. They reject the institution of a one-party dictatorship and state capitalism in favor of council vanguard_communism, replacing democraticcentralism with workers' councils and soviet democracy. Rivalries between the KAPD and their Leninist counterparts have continued to flare up in the unstable political climate.§!"

They became affiliated with the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, an organization of left-socialists that rejected the Third International and mainstream social democraticideology.

GER_nihilistic_extremism_party_long:0 "Organisation Consul \n§g A radical militant organization, the far-right paramilitary has been led by Heinrich Himmler since mid-1935. Himmler drastically reshaped the organization's platform, arguing that only embracing nihlism could redeem Germany's degeneracy; he avowed that everything, including life itself, is truly worthless. As such, the OC kill and torture with impunity in order to 'rid the world of decadence, degeneracy, and the filth of humanity' thus allowing them to fulfill their role as the ubermensch. Achieving the "ewiger kriegszustand" or eternal state of war, in which man is liberated of idleness and weakness is seen as the end goal of Himmler's twisted ideology. Ultimately, Himmler and his cult-like following seek domination and control.§!"

#Leaders
POLITICS_VON_SCHLEICHER_DESC:0 "A well respected figure within the Reichswehr, Kurt von Schleicher despised the republican government and sought to instate a nationalistic dictatorship - a stance embraced by most of the other Reichswehr officers and generals. With Hans von Seeckt's November Putsch, Schleicher's desire to see the republic crumble was granted. Nonetheless, Schleicher has become disillusioned with the 'Bolshevization' of Seeckt's regime. With Seeckt's age becoming apparent, Schleicher has come to recognize that an opportunity to steer Germany down a different path is soon to be opening. Schleicher is an opportunist and a staunch nationalist who will do whatever is necessary to restore Germany's greatness."
POLITICS_VON_SEECKT_DESC:0 "In the midst of chaos, Germany needed a strong leader to rise and save the nation from collapse. Hans von Seeckt aligned himself with the Bavarian triumvirate (Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Hans Ritter von Seisser, and Otto von Lossow) to crush the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch and restore order. With the feeble republic crumbling apart, Seeckt recognized that this would be the only opportunity to seize power and restructure Germany into a nation that could one-day reclaim its rightful lands. The Reichswehr occupied the Reichstag and declared the dissolution of the Weimar Republic. Under his rule, the German Reich would undergo vast changes. Hans von Seeckt single-handedly reformed the Reichswehr into a capable fighting force - in spite of the harsh restrictions imposed by the French and British. He strengthened ties between Germany and the Soviet Union and has vastly improved Germany's military readiness. His military expertise is unquestioned within the Reichswehr, although his fondness towards the Bolsheviks has made more reactionary generals uneasy."
POLITICS_GOTTFRIED_FEDER_DESC:0 "Vocal in his opposition to Seeckt's 'capitulation towards the Bolsheviks', Gottfried Feder and the DAP have become the face of the anti-communist far-right in Germany."

rampant_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Germany has been plagued with paramilitary violence since the end of the Great War. The Weimar government, seen as illegitimate by the far left and right, had failed to put an end to the issue. Since Seeckt's Putsch of '23, paramilitary activity has surged in popularity by a resurgence in radical factions. Until drastic action is taken, warfare comparable to that of the Great War will continue to occur in German streets."
black_reichswehr:0 "Black Reichswehr"
black_reichswehr_desc:0 "Formed in the period of the Weimar Republic, the Black Reichswehr is a group of paramilitary organisations free from any law or legislation. They are supported by the main army, the Reichswehr, as an auxiliary army used to circumvent restrictions imposed upon Germany's military by the Treaty of Versailles. The Black Reichswehr is a great asset to us and our army, and will surely prove useful in the event of a conflict."
economic_troubles:0 "Half-Crippled Economy"
economic_troubles_desc:0 "Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles stated that Germany, out of our allies, should accept most, if not full, responsibility for starting the First World War. The article also stated for us to pay reparations to the Allies for the damage caused. This, on top of a severely damaged industry, an unstable government and constant skirmishes with paramilitaries in the street that causes even more damage to infrastructure, makes it nearly impossible for us to rebuild our economy any time soon." 
sour_loser:0 "Bitter Loser"
sour_loser_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles humiliated the German nation, stripping us of everything we had ever worked for. We were so close... so close to achieving victory, so close to taking Paris, so close to taking Rome. If it wasn't those damn Allies that had shown up in France and those traitors who stabbed us in the back in the home front! We will not stand for this! Germany shall rise once again, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. We are that phoenix, and we will show them, we will take revenge! Our goal in the First World War was to crush the Allied powers, and that, as Gott as our witness, is what we will do, to finish what we started two decades prior! Gott Mit Uns!"

privatizations_desc:0 "After much debate, the government has decided to pursue a policy of privatization. Many of the government corporations selected for privatization were financial burdens and will be more efficiently ran as private entities. Public-held firms in the mining, steel processing, and heavy industries are to be sold off, generating revenue for the state. The extra revenue can be put towards remilitarization, and other high priority areas of the national agenda."

lucrative_contracts_desc:0 "Millions of Reichsmarks have been set aside for business contracts with German industrialists. Under the guise of front companies, they will produce armaments that will be be used to refit the Reichswehr. These contracts are expected to be highly sought after, and highly profitable for the contractor. Nonetheless, this has been determined to be the best method for maintaining control of the rearming process, whilst also keeping our hands clean in the event we are caught."

job_training:0 "Job Training Initiatives"
job_training_desc:0 "Our focus must be directed towards getting the hundreds of thousands of idle Germans back into the workforce. These people must be provided the skills and tools to provide for themselves, and more importantly to provide for their nation.

germany.1.d:0 "The German Empire's defeat in the Great War brought chaos and revolutionary change to Germany. Large swathes of territories were stripped away, and costly war reparations devastated the German economy. The feeble republic, established in the aftermath of the war, was plagued with violence from rogue paramilitaries and revolutionaries. \n\n On November 8th, 1923, the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei under the leadership of Adolph Hitler and Erich Ludendorff attempted to overthrow the government. In response to the coup attempt, martial law was declared and a nationalst triumvirate was formed. The triumvirate: Gustav von Kahr, General Otto von Lossow, and Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser aligned themselves with the Minister of the Reichswehr, Hans von Seeckt. Hitler was shot by the Bavarian State Police, and General Ludendorff was arrested shortly after. \n\n Seeckt used the incident as justification to occupy the Reichstag and dissolve the government. The Schutzputsch, as it has come to be known, brought about the demise of the Weimar Republic. Since November of 1923, Germany has been a military dictatorship under Hans von Seeckt..."

The sale of these industries to the industrialists would help to offset budget deficits, and likewise would please the industrialists. On the other hand, several advisors have stated that a better approach would be to offer lucrative government contracts, particularly military contracts, to the industrialists.

germany.24.d:0 "The Germans have sent a delegation of diplomats to negotiate the establishment of a 'Continental Bloc' between our nations, which would serve to counter-balance the Franco-British hegemony and solidify both nations' interests in Eastern and Central Europe. This proposal sits on our desk, waiting to be either vetoed or signed into law."

germany.26.d:0 "Today diplomats from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the German Reich have come together to sign the most powerful document of the century. The final setbacks in the negotiation process have been overcome; the Soviet Union and Germany have now signed and ratified the Continental Bloc Treaty. Provisions of the treaty call for the mutual military aid in the event of war, the exchange of technology between nations, joint military exercises, and the delineation of 'zones of influence' in the event that the borders of Europe should change."

germany.27.d:0 "The German Reich has requested the repatriation to Germany, of hundreds of thousands of Wolgadeutsch or Volga Germans. Should we comply with this request, we would be tasked with deporting thousands of people to Germany. Cooperation would leave us with one less pesky minority group to worry about. Nonetheless, within the Politburo this is seen by many as a betrayal of fellow citizens and a capitulation towards the Germans."

Several German units are believed to still be within Polish territory. One of our generals has insisted we implement a 'shoot on sight' policy, defending our borders by any and all means.

germany.32.t:0 "The Poles Back Down"
germany.32.d:0 "After a tense diplomatic standoff, the Polish government has backed down and attempted to de-escalate the current situation.

Our position is clear, Poland acted in aggression towards our nation, and we demand justice in return!"

germany.34.t:0 "Soviets Decline Our Offer"

Kurt von Schleicher, a highly respected general, ultimately convinced Seeckt of the true dangers of the Red Menace to the East. In lieu of previous plans, an Anti-Komintern Pact has been drafted. The Pact will align us closer with Soviet Russia's enemies... but such is fate! "

germany.36.d:0 "There has been great internal debate as to the solution of Germany's paramilitary issue. For years our nation has struggled with violence at the hands of rogue thugs, many of whom continue to plot against the government. Some within the regime believe that an official paramilitary organization should be established, allowing us to keep tabs on potential radicals. Other officials believe that we should fully abolish them, and instate martial law in the cities to disarm the civilian populace... Both arguments have their merit, but a choice must be made."
