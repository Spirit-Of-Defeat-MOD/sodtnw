POLITICS_WILHELMINA_DESC:0 "For centuries the family of Orange-Nassau has been interwoven with the very history of the Netherlands itself. Like her forefather William the Silent in the Eighty Years' War, the current Queen, Wilhelmina, will undoubtedly prove an inspiration for Dutchmen rallying to the defense of their homeland, should their country ever be invaded."
