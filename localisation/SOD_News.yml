sodnews.1.d:0 "Paul Joseph Goebbels, an obscure writer, known only among German far-right circles, made headlines with the release of Der Große Kampf. The novel, which translates to 'The Great Struggle' in English, details an alternate history in which Adolf Hitler survived being shot by the Bavarian State Police. Seeckt's Schutzputsch in retaliation to Hitler's would also crumble apart after SPD led strikes and French reprisals. \n\n In the aftermath of the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch, the young Hitler would face five years of imprisonment, during which time he would lay out his vision for a Third Reich. He recognized he would have to use the political system against itself, and would blame the Jews, foreginers, and traitors within the military for his failures. \n\n The novel concludes with Hitler ascending to power in 1931, after great political turmoil in Germany... \n\n Historians have laughed off the novel's premise as unthinkable, and the Seeckt administration has outlawed the work as treasonous material. Goebbels is believed to have fled to Geneva to avoid prosecution of 'authoring treasonous materials'."
