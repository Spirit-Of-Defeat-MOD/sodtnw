 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC:0 "Born into a Catholic family in Munich, Himmler's world would be torn apart as he saw his nation humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles. Multiple times Himmler would attempt to join the Reichswehr, although he would never be successful. Turned down by the military, and frustrated with the political situation of Germany, Himmler would become deeply involved with far-right groups. \n\nHimmler's frustrations would culminate in him dropping out of university in 1921. He would devote much of his time to participating in paramilitary organizations and writing manifestos. Ernst Rohm would become one of his closest friends, and Himmler would be an early member of the Verband Reichskriegsflagge.The friendship would not last, and Himmler was forced to leave Rohm and the VRKF behind. \n\nHimmler was determined to continue the struggle for his nation, and ended up joining the Organisation Consul. The Organisation Consul gave Himmler a cause, and he participated in terrorist attacks, assassinations, and skirmishes in the Inter-Allied Rhineland, which to him was an egregious abomination on the map. Through the years Himmler would rise through the ranks slowly, but steadily. \n\nBy 1935, Himmler was among the most respected commanders among members of the Organisation Consul. After Hermann Ehrhardt's mysterious death, Himmler easily secured the leadership position. By this point his mental health had seriously deteriorated as a result of his first-hand experiences as a terrorist and partisan against the occupation regime. In spite of all this, Himmler had just reached his 'enlightenment' on the ideology he would call Nihilism. \n\nBased on Himmler's interpretations of Cioranist literature, Nihilism would call for a totalitarian state which is rebuked of all tradition. The state would seek to eradicate all culture, and to create an 'eternal state of war', which would in turn cleanse the world of degeneracy. In Himmler's view, Nihilism is necessary to wipe society clean from cultures which are in constant decay, and replace them with a 'cultural state of nothingness.'"

 rhine_himmler.1.t:0 "Factories Sabotaged"
 rhine_himmler.1.d:0 "Several factories were sabotaged by terrorists in an arson attack. It took three hours for firefighters to contain the flames, and another hour to fully extinguish the blaze. Fortunately, all of the workers were able to escape before they would be consumed by the vicious flames. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment was lost. Rebuilding and renovating the damaged structures will take time - and the blow to our economy will surely be felt." #Gib new description sneak its your job now :). Can also use "[Root.Capital.GetName]" for specifics if needed
 rhine_himmler.1.a:0 "At Least No One Was Killed" #facs destroyed but no casualties

 rhine_himmler.2.t:0 "Terrorist Strike Factories"
 rhine_himmler.2.d:0 "Two large explosions were heard in Bonn this morning. Authorities were in utter shock as they saw the horiffic damages caused by these attacks. Five people in total have been confirmed dead; another two dozen have been hospitalized. The target of the attack was an industrial building manufacturing goods to be exported to France. Although the investigations are still underway, all signs point to Himmler's Organisation Consul being behind the attacks. Garrisons in the area have been place on high alert."
 rhine_himmler.2.a:0 "May God Have Mercy On Us All..." #facs destroyed and minus 5 manpower

 rhine_himmler.3.t:0 "French Citizens Held Hostage"
 rhine_himmler.3.d:0 "Three French citizens were abducted by the Organisation Consul in Köln. Letters have been sent to the offices of our governing commission demanding the dissolvement of our government and the complete withdrawal of foreign troops. They state that, if we do not comply with their demands, the French hostages will 'drown in their own blood and face a fate worse than any other'. This is not the first crisis we've faced, and it won't be the last; but lately, these terrorists have grown bolder and more violent."

 rhine_himmler.4.t:0 "French Citizens Massacred" #toned down for kstar hundreds of casualties are now only dozens
 rhine_himmler.4.d:0 "In one of the worst massacres in recent memory, Himmler's terrorists massacred dozens of innocent civilians and killed several police officers and military personnel. A squad of armed radicals stormed the carnival events and laid waste to anyone present. Before large numbers of troops could be dispatched to put down the terrorists, they seemingly disappeared. The unpredictable nature of these attacks eludes us... we struggle to predict and prepare for them. The sickening depravity of this terrorism is unlike anything we've ever witnessed."

 rhine_himmler.5.t:0 "Teens Abducted From Schools"
 rhine_himmler.5.d:0 "Across our territory, incidents have been popping up of children and teens being abducted by terrorists. Evidence leads us to Himmler's Organisation Consul being behind these kidnappings, in addition to various other attacks and massacres."

rhine_himmler.6.t:0 "Children Missing" #this is the darkest thing we have, Dirlewanger and Himmler abducting kids...
rhine_himmler.6.d:0 "Local reports have been coming in, documenting tens of cases, in which children were abducted from their homes in the middle of the night. Rumors have been spreading that Himmler's Organisation Consul is behind the abductions; furthermore, they claim that he has delegated a close associate of his, Oskar Dirlewanger, to form a platoon of child soldiers. If these rumors are to be believed, Himmler may be amassing an army of teens and children who wouldn't dare question his orders. The decision to have Dirlewanger in charge is also quite concerning..."

rhine_himmler.8.t:0 "Politician Executed"
rhine_himmler.8.d:0 "A local representative was shot and killed this morning under peculiar circumstances. Investigators believe that the Organisation Consul may be tied with this murder. There have not been any witnesses according to police interviews, and the locals seem afraid to cooperate with our investigation. Many of the senior investigators believe that the locals are under duress, being coerced into feigning ignorance. Could they be onto something?"

rhine_himmler.9.t:0 "Defectors Reveal Plot"
rhine_himmler.9.d:0 "Two young men turned themselves in to the local police precinct. They claim to have been members of the Organisation Consul, but have since grown disillusioned of the violence. Their eyes convey nothing but terror, and tears slowly roll down their cheeks. One of them whimpers quitely, while the other says they are surely to be killed - either by the police or by Himmler. Nonetheless, the whimpering boy situated himself and claims to have knowledge on an upcoming attack on Düren."

rhine_himmler.10.t:0 "Terrorist Plot Foiled"
rhine_himmler.10.d:0 "Security forces have just foiled a plot by the terrorists to release toxic mustard gas in the city of Düren, one of the wealthiest and most productive cities in the Rhine. We managed to capture the terrorist before he could execute the attack - but if we hadn't, dozens of lives could have been lost. Our attempts to interrogate the captive terrorist have failed to yield any useful intelligence on the group's plots, organization, or source of funding. This potential lead has turned into a dead end, and this terrorist has seemingly outlived his usefulness."
