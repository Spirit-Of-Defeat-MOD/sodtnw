"

That decision will now be reversed as the first step of abolishing the commission and replacing it with a legislature for the German people."

#Events
rhine_political.1.t:0 "Meeting of the Commission"
rhine_political.1.d:0 "Today a meeting of the IARHC has been called. While issues such as domestic terrorism and social unrest will be discussed, the main topic will be the commission itself. Delegates of the Allied powers will meet in this debate along with some German observers. Chairman Paul Tirard claims he looks forward to the debate, seeking to put forward his views. Although the other delegetes are a bit skeptical of his excitement. \n\n The United Kingdom and the United States are clear on their position of limiting and eventually abolishing the council in favour of having the region eventually rejoin the German State or setting up a government to be the true sucessor the German Empire. The French on the other hand are in favour of setting up the Rhine with its own government; to try and separate Rhineland from Germany completely, as was their original Great War plan of dismantling the German State. \n\n These clashes of ambition will surely be an obstacle in decsion making in the future, but only time will tell."
