#Focuses
RHI_commission_fate:0 "Fate of the High Commission"
RHI_commission_fate_desc:0 "With the increased unrest of the populace and the occupation forces due to terror attacks allegedly sponsored by the Seeckt government and Anti-French propganda campaigns, the Inter Rhineland Allied High Commission(IRAHC) and its status has been called into question. \nThe Powers that make up the commission will meet in due time, to discuss its role and its very existence with the current state of affairs. "
RHI_limit_commission:0 "Limit Commission Power"
RHI_limit_commission_desc:0 "Ever since the occupation of Baden and the Rhineland, the powers of the commission have extended to be the sole policy making entity in the region - even despite opposition from the United States and local German officials. That decision will now be reversed as the first step of abolishing the commission and replacing it with a legislature for the German people."

#Events
rhine_political.1.t:0 "Meeting of the Commission"
rhine_political.1.d:0 "Today a meeting of the IARHC has been called. While issues such as domestic terrorism and social unrest will be discussed, the main topic will be the commission itself. Delegates of the Allied powers will meet in this debate along with some German observers. Chairman Paul Tirard claims he looks forward to the debate, seeking to put forward his views. Although the other delegetes are a bit skeptical of his excitement. \n\n The United Kingdom and the United States are clear on their position of limiting and eventually abolishing the council in favour of having the region eventually rejoin the German State or setting up a government to be the true sucessor the German Empire. The French on the other hand are in favour of setting up the Rhine with its own government; to try and separate Rhineland from Germany completely, as was their original Great War plan of dismantling the German State. \n\n These clashes of ambition will surely be an obstacle in decsion making in the future, but only time will tell."

organization_consul:0 "The Organization Consul" 
organization_consul_desc:0 "A radical militant organization, the far-right paramilitary has been led by Heinrich Himmler since mid-1935. Himmler drastically reshaped the organization's platform, arguing that only embracing nihlism could redeem Germany's degeneracy, this has lead to him organizing terrorist attacks in order to instil fear in the population as a means to try and control them. While not many attacks have been carried out with the ambtition of the IARHC to progress forward we can not rule out him ramping up his efforts.  \n\nPopulation Fear: [GetPopulationFearEffects]                                                                                   \n\nThese are their Bases of operations: [GetOcBasesEffects] [GetOcBasesEffects1] [GetOcBasesEffects2] [GetOcBasesEffects3] [GetOcBasesEffects4]"
