#Ideas
extortionate_taxes:0 "Extortionate Taxation"
extortionate_taxes_desc:0 "Virtually every aspect of life in Shanxi is taxed. Workers and peasants struggle to make ends meet, often making great sacrifices to survive. Despite disatisfaction from his subjects, Yan Xishan has ignored their demands and retaliated with threats of further increases in taxation. In Xishan's view, these taxes are a necessary sacrifice to ensure that China may become a great power. To his subjects, these taxes are legalized robbery..."
severe_unemployment:0 "Severe Unemployment"
severe_unemployment_desc:0 "Shanxi's economy is in a dire state. Foreign markets have dumped loads of cheap surplus goods into the province, leading to local businesses being driven out. As a result, one-third of Shanxi's citizenry are currently unemployed."
irrational_progress:0 "Irrational Progress"
irrational_progress_desc:0 "Yan Xishan seeks to make Shanxi the industrial heartland of Northwestern China; he has done all in his power to industrialize the province. His deep-rooted emotional commitment to progress has lead him 'to promote industrialization for its own sake', rather than focusing on other matters. This has lead to great suffering amongst his people. Instead of addressing these issues, Xishan merely berates their weakness and obsessively lectures on the need for extreme self-sacrifice."
opium_addiction:0 "Opium Addiction"
opium_addiction_desc:0 "The sale of opium has been monopolized by the state under the pretext of selling it as a 'medicine' to addicts. Contrary to Yan Xishan's intentions, monopolizing opium has only worsened the issue. Addicts sacrifice their meager belongings to get high, and black markets have lead to an increase in crime. Shanxi is faced with a crisis, and these addicts and black market criminals must both be dealt with."
