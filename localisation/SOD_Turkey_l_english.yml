 turkey.1.t:0 "Ottoman Empire Introduction"
 turkey.1.d:0 "The 'Sick Man of Europe' had been outmatched in the Great War and the Ottoman Empire had all but collapsed. Turkish nationalists fought a long struggle against all odds in the so-called Turkish War of Independence. This war devastated the country, leaving the ruins of a scorched earth behind. Despite the best efforts of the rebels, their sacrifices would be in vain. \n\n Mustafa Kemal Pasha would be captured and executed, and the remaining nationalist forces were disorganized and fatigued. Within months of Pasha's capture, the Turkish rebels were all but defeated. \n\n The Treaty of Lausanne would place harsh conditions on the defeated Turks. A sad excuse of an empire, one which had been in critical condition for decades, was propped back up as the legitimate government. Vast amounts of land would be stripped away from the Ottomans, including their last European holdings in Thrace and the historic capital city of Constantinople. \n\n The terms of surrender were nothing short of humiliating, and the unrest and disatisfaction have echoed and amplified over the years. Lust for blood and soil dominates the national psyche."
