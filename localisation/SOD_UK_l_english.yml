uk.1.t:0 "King George V passes away"
uk.1.d:0 "It is with sorrow that we forward this news from Buckingham Palace to you now. King of the United Kingdom, the British Dominions, and Emperor of India George Frederick Ernest Albert V has passed away. Although many medical experts of the empire - even some of our greatest - expected him to live for another ten years at least, it turns out that it is not the case. He died peacefully at midnight last night, with his family, doctors and close friends with him. Although the circumstances of the king’s death are unknown, his health problems and severe depression is thought to have certainly played a major role in his passing. \n\nHis Majesty reigned for two and a half decades, leading the Empire through some of it’s darkest hours and dire times. He managed our empire through to its eventual victory in World War I and through the Lombard Street Stock Market Crash of 1923, which caused the bankruptcy of many companies, and a few major ones too. \n\nHis eldest son, the Prince of Wales Edward shall inherit the crown and assume the title Edward VIII. Many are concerned he is too independent of thought; the government is preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
uk.1.a:0 "Rest in peace, Your Majesty."
