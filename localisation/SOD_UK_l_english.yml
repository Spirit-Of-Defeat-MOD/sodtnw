uk.1.t:0 "King George V passes away"
uk.1.d:0 "It is with sorrow that we forward this news from Buckingham Palace to you now. King of the United Kingdom, the British Dominions, and Emperor of India George Frederick Ernest Albert V has passed away. Although many medical experts of the empire - even some of our greatest - expected him to live for another ten years at least, it turns out that it is not the case. He died peacefully at midnight last night, with his family, doctors and close friends with him. Although the circumstances of the king’s death are unknown, his health problems and severe depression is thought to have certainly played a major role in his passing. \n\nHis Majesty reigned for two and a half decades, leading the Empire through some of it’s darkest hours and dire times. He managed our empire through to its eventual victory in World War I and through the Lombard Street Stock Market Crash of 1929, which caused the bankruptcy of many companies, and a few major ones too. \n\nHis eldest son, the Prince of Wales Edward shall inherit the crown and assume the title Edward VIII. Many are concerned he is too independent of thought; the government is preparing to make sure he will accept direction from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet."
uk.1.a:0 "Rest in peace, Your Majesty."
uk.1000.t:0 "Remembrance Day"
uk.1000.d:0 "The streets of London, and other cities across the isle for that matter were quiet, quiet for today was Remembrance Day. This day, November 11 is the anniversary of the end of the Great War, the cessation of fighting on the Western front, from Ypres to Belfort, where man saw the best and the worst of himself, where friendships formed from mud and blood and were lost in craters and trenches as quickly as they had come.\n\n[ENG.GetLeader] emerged from his vehicle, greeted to a regiment of Royal Guardsmen lined in formation, their red uniforms, tall hats and stern expression able to put the strongest-willed man at unease. Directly behind them a large crowd of civvies had gathered for the annual procession. In front of [ENG.GetLeader] was The Cenotaph, the memorial of the fallen.\n\nCannon fire rang through the city as [ENG.GetLeader] laid the wreath upon the stone of the monument. During the two-minute-silence in honour of the fallen, deep in his heart, he thought most dearly and truly he hoped he would not bear witness to another Great War, to any more suffering or death or destruction, to any more orphaned children or dead young men. But this thought was suddenly shot out of his mind with a bugle man's rendition of the last post. The yearly memorial service had come to an end.\n\n‘They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them.’\n\nLest we Forget." 
uk.1000.a:0 "Lest we Forget."



#Descriptions

POLITICS_EDWARD_VIII_DESC:0 "Edward VIII, the head of the House of Windsor, and with that status comes responsibility. Yet he is as radical as they come. Despite his status as heir to the throne, he has done little to prove his readiness and maturity, instead preferring to spend his time with his several mistresses he encountered in his times overseas. Near the end of his teenage years saw the start of the Great War, yet to his chagrin was unable to serve, restricted to behind the front due to his status as royalty, thus never experiencing the trenches and battlefields of the war. To appease his boredom he wandered the streets of Paris late in the night, eventually landing upon the red-light districts of the city. It is here his womanising begins, which has continued up until the present and has concerned even the king himself.\n\nNow with his father, George V having died, Edward’s coronation day nears, yet some believe due to his current reckless behaviour he is unfit for this position. Such claim can be backed up, as many describe Edward as an immature, impatient, indecisive man of the limelight, placing media attention as a higher priority to the wellbeing of his subjects. It is either Edward VIII reforms his behaviour now, or risk abdication a mere few months into his reign. Only time shall tell."
