usa.1.t:0 "Pershing requests to return to active service!"
usa.1.d:0 "Although having retired in 1924, General of the Armies John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing has offered to come out of retirement and serve his nation in this time of war. Pershing served in the Great War as the commander of the American Expeditionary Force and led his forces to victory, and in a letter to the president he requests to be returned to active military service in order to oversee the command of the armed forces in this war and achieve victory once again. Though skilled and highly experienced, many other commanders in the army are reluctant as to whether or not his ideas are still up-to-date, since military tactics and warfare has come a considerable legnth since World War One."
usa.1.a:0 "He must return to the military."
