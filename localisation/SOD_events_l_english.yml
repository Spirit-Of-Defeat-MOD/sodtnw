intro.1.d:0 "Hello there dear player and welcome to the wide and wonderful world of Spirit of Defeat! After months of back breaking slave labour, I mean, fun and wonderful work with high wages, our first version of this mod, 0.1, has finally been released. This alternate history mod features great, expansive focus trees for the majors and several minor countries, hundreds of new portraits of commanders and leaders, hundreds of flavour events to make or break your country, new ideologies and a complete rework of the minister system.\n\nSince this mod is in its early Alpha stages and has just been released, there are bound to be bugs. It would be a great favour if you were to report such bugs on our discord server or our subreddit, where our team will do what we can to fix them.\n\nWell, it’s time this talk has ended, and time to play. Have fun!"

intro.1.d:0 "Spirit of Defeat is set in a world very different from the one you've known. Germany has become a military dictatorship led by Hans von Seeckt. Italy has carved up the Balkans following their victory in the Third Balkan War. These partitions have established unsustainable borders in the Balkans... the powder-keg fuse has been lit. Zinoviev has taken reigns of the Soviet Union following the death of Vladimir Lenin. China is in utter shambles as various warlords vie for power. Japan has been steadily remilitarizing. The United States has isolated itself from European affairs, all the while, propping up loyal 'banana republic' dictatorships across South America. Britain and France have been struggling to maintain the peace in Europe - although their attempts seem to be in vain as Germany and the USSR become emboldened by the day."
