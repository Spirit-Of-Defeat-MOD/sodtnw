intro.1.d:0 "Hello there dear player and welcome to the wide and wonderful world of Spirit of Defeat! After months of back breaking slave labour, I mean, fun and wonderful work with high wages, our first version of this mod, 0.1, has finally been released. We feature new and improved focus trees for the majors and several minor countries, hundreds of new portraits, new ideologies and a complete rework of the minister system.\n\nSince this mod is in its early Alpha stages and has just been released, there are bound to be bugs. It would be a great favour if you were to report such bugs on our discord server or our subreddit, where our team will do what we can to fix them.\n\nWell, it’s time this talk has ended, and time to play. Have fun!"
