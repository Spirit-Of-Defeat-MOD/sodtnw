intro.1.t:0 "Welcome to Spirit of Defeat"
intro.1.d:0 "Spirit of Defeat is set in a world very different from the one you've known. Germany has become a military dictatorship led by Hans von Seeckt. Italy has carved up the Balkans following their victory in the Third Balkan War. These partitions have established unsustainable borders in the Balkans... the powder-keg fuse has been lit. Zinoviev has taken reigns of the Soviet Union following the death of Vladimir Lenin. China is in utter shambles as various warlords vie for power. Japan has been steadily remilitarizing. The United States has isolated itself from European affairs, all the while, propping up loyal 'banana republic' dictatorships across South America. Britain and France have been struggling to maintain the peace in Europe - although their attempts seem to be in vain as Germany and the USSR become emboldened by the day."
