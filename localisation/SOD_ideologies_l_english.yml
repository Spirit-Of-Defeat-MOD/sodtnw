 #Sub Ideology Descriptions
 totalitarian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 ""
 anti_revisionism_desc:0 "A reaction to the many ideologies claiming to be successors to Marxism, Anti-Revisionism advocates retaining key elements of original revolutionary theory. Mainly opposing incorporation of capitalist economic elements into socialist states, the ideology is defined as much by what it isn't as what it is."
 national_bolshevik_desc:0 "National Bolshevism is a synthesis of radical nationalism and the revolutionary activity and socialist economics of the Bolsheviks. This syncretic ideology was born in the aftermath of the Great War, as a current within the KPD sought to rally nationalist forces within the army, in support of revolutionary Marxism."
 vanguard_communism_subtype_desc:0 ""
 leninist_desc:0 "A political ideology based in Marxist thought, Leninism seeks to establish a socialist state by a vanguard party leading a revolution overthrowing capitalist society. Once in power, the party rules through a system whereby policies are open for internal debate until a decision has been made."
 marxism_desc:0 "Encompassing a broad spectrum of economic and historical views, Marxist politics seek to apply the theories of Karl Marx to political practice. Class struggle and the need for transition to a society based on common ownership of the means of production characterize these ideologies."
 leninism_desc:0 "A political ideology based in Marxist thought, Leninism seeks to establish a socialist state by a vanguard party leading a revolution overthrowing capitalist society. Once in power, the party rules through a system whereby policies are open for internal debate until a decision has been made."
 stalinism_desc:0 "Identifying as a form of government applying and developing Marxist-Leninist policies, Stalinism emphasizes rapid industrialization and collectivization as well as the need for a strong, authorative socialist state to purge any counter-revolutionary elements."
 trotskyist_desc:0 ""
 market_socialism_desc:0 ""
 chen_ideology_desc:0 "Consisting of elements of federalism, anarchism, socialism, and internationalism - the ideology of Chen Jiongming is quite unique compared to any other. Four pillars tie together these elements of Chen's ideology: freedom, equality, fraternal love, and mutual aid. Chen believes that humanity must 'evolve to a stage where people enjoy the happiness of full equality and suffer no bondage of states, nations, or individuals.' He fully embraces self-sacrifice and calls for a 'socialism of all mankind' in which assistance is offered to any oppresed nation. To fulfill this, he calls for a society structured from the bottom up, in which every village is represented through democracy. To achieve world harmony, Asia, Europe, and America must be formed into separate federations, of which would unite to form one federation."
 revolutionary_socialism_subtype_desc:0 ""
 anarchist_communism_desc:0 "An ideology embracing the idea of communism as a stateless society, Anarchist Communism eschews the idea of a transitionary socialist state and favors a society based on voluntary associations and mutual aid."
 anarchist_syndicalism_desc:0 "An ideology embracing the idea of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and thus control influence in broader society."

 radical_liberalism_desc:0 ""
 keynesian_liberalism_desc:0 "Keynesian liberals believe that in times of economic downturn, increased government spending can minimize the severity of an economic recession.

 liberal_conservatism_desc:0 ""
 classic_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Classical liberals advocate for a limited government which protects the rights of individual citizens, and provides only the services that cannot be provided by the free market. Adherents of classic liberal thought believe in 'negative rights', which oblige inaction on behalf of the government - such as the right to free speech. Unlike social liberals, they do not believe in the existence of 'positive rights' which are granted by the government to citizens - such as the right to an education or public housing."
 market_liberalism_desc:0 "Market liberalism is a subset of classic liberalism with a strong emphasis on the importance of Laissez Faire capitalism. Supply, demand, and the profit motive ensure that both labor and capital receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand. The Invisible Hand alone is to dictate the course of markets, and the government primarily is tasked with establishing the legal system and common defense."
 constitutionalism_desc:0 "Constitutionalists believe in a strict adherence to a constitutional form of government, with limited government powers. Conservatism is an important aspect of constitutionalist belief, as the founding principles of the nation are seen as an unchanging standard to be abided by.

They are among the most staunch defenders of Laissez Faire capitalism, and shun government interference in business and in the lives of the citizenry."
 social_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "Social conservatism advocates for the preservation of the status quo through the maintenace of traditional values and established insitutions. Conservatives are skeptical of radical change, believing that society is founded upon fragile relationships."
 fiscal_conservatism_desc:0 "Fiscal conservatives advocate for low taxes, reduced government, expenditures, and a balanced budget. Deregulation, privatization, and austerity measures are among the tools used to achieve fiscal conservatism."
 traditionalism_desc:0 "Traditionalists hold that time tested values and customs, passed from generation to generation, are what keeps society together. Change is seen as a relatively dangerous force; one which can destroy thousands of years of tradition and stability."
 christian_democracy_desc:0 ""
 reactionary_conservatism_desc:0 "Reactionary conservatism rejects the status quo in favor of returning society to an earlier state. Unlike typical conservatives, reactionaries see the current state of affairs as unsatisfactory.

These states are paternalistic, believing that the populace is generally incapable of recognizing what is in their best interest, and that a strong leader is required to guide the people."
 paternal_state_desc:0 ""
 absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "Absolute monarchism is founded on the 'Divine Right of Kings', believing that the royal head of state is endowed the right to rule from a higher power. The monarch has absolute power, and may delegate local authority to other nobility."
 warlord_desc:0 "Warlords are regional military commanders with the ability to excerise control over the military, economic, and political developments of their territory. Often, warlords are seen as illegitimate leaders and have little diplomatic recognition of their territorial claims."
 military_junta_desc:0 "A military junta is an autocratic form of government in which the state is led by a committee of military leaders who have taken power by force. Oftentimes, military juntas come to power under the guise of protecting the people and securing the state from ‘dangerous ideologies’ such as communism or socialism."
 totalitarian_state_desc:0 "Totalitarianism seeks to destroy opposition to the state through political repression, economic centralization, mass surveilance, and the restriction of individual liberties.

 nihilistic_extremism_subtype_desc:0 "Nihilistic extremism is characterized by a strong belief in the extermination of perceived sources of degeneracy, and a tendency towards a totalitarian state. Concepts derived from Nietzche and Cioran - such as the Ubermensch, the Will to Power, the absence of moral truths, and radical pessimism -  have been completely corrupted, and merged with Social Darwinst and exterminationist rhetoric. Nihilistic extremists will do whatever is necessary to ensure that their fanatical visions may be achieved."
 himmlerist_nihilism_desc:0 "Himmlerist Nihilism is driven by an intense paranoia of degeneracy - which is believed to originate from pacifism, liberalism, traditionalism, egalitarianism, 'Judeo-Bolshevism' and the decay of existing cultures. Only a totalitarian state, which is rebuked of all tradition, can initiate an eternal state of war against degeneracy. This war against degeneracy will erase the decay of existing systems and restore the only true 'original culture', the cultural state of nothingness. Morals and ethics are seen as artificial human projections that contradict the 'struggle for existence in which the incapable must perish to sustain the survivors.' According to Himmlerist Nihilism, only the fires of war can truly cleanse humanity from eons of degeneracy."
 cioranist_nihilism_desc:0 "Cioranist Nihilism orignated as a critique of the degeneration of society and the cultures that compose societies. Emil Cioran advocated for a totalitarian state, rebuked of tradition to combat degeneracy. He detailed non-violent methods that the state could use to eradicate degeneracy. With the rise of Heinrich Himmler and his violent Himmlerist strain of Nihilism, followers of Cioranist thought have been forced underground."
 pronayist_nihilism_desc:0 "Seeking to 'restore the traditional good relations between the landlords and estate servants', Pronayist ideology utilizes brutality and mass terror to ensure the subservient nature of the peasant class remains. Reprisals against anyone suspected of being Jewish or a leftist are undertaken publically. Depraved methods and demonic creativity are utilized to strike fear into the hearts of the citizenry and to set an example of those who dare to step out of line."
 radical_paramilitarist_desc:0 "Members of radical paramilitaries typically embrace extremist rhetoric and dogmatic ideology - utilizing weaponry and their specialized training to put down opposition groups forcibly. Paramilitarists are incredibly violent and act outside the boundaries of the law."
 right_wing_terrorist_desc:0 "Right-wing terrorism encompasses a broad spectrum of movements. Typically these organizations espouse xenophobic rhetoric and seek the preservation or restoration of prior glory at the expense of outsiders deemed unworthy. They embrace incredibly violent methods and have no problem with targeting innocent civilians... Fear only makes them stronger."
 esoteric_nihilist_desc:0 "Esoteric Nihilism combines occultist practices with Himmlerist rehetoric regarding the degeneration of cultures. In Esoteric Nihilist belief, only through the efforts of a small clique of the 'enlightened' can a pure culture be uncovered. Those with the inside knowledge must do all in their power to preserve the secrecy of the group and to exterminate all alien cultures that threaten the purity of their own."
 anarcho_nihilist_desc:0 "Anarcho-Nihilism is a form of the ideology based on the conclusion that the state itself is a product of degeneracy. Adherents believe that the existence of the state supresses the will to survive and serves only as a protective shield for cultural decay. As such, only through the means of achieving anarchy can degeneracy be cleansed through the natural Darwinian struggle."
