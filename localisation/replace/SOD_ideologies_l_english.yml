 libertarian_socialist_ideology:0 "Libertarian Socialism"
 libertarian_socialist_ideology_desc:0 "Libertarian socialism is a socialist political system that rejects the state socialist notion of socialism as a statist version in which the state retains centralized control of the economy. Libertarian socialists, who overlap with anarchist and libertarianism, reject wage slavery connections in the workplace, emphasizing workers' self-management and decentralized political systems. Libertarian socialism encompasses anarchist, Marxist, and anarchist- or Marxist-inspired philosophy, as well as other left-libertarian orientations, as a broad socialist philosophy and movement."
 anarchist_syndicalist:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 anarchist_syndicalist_desc:0 "Anarcho-syndicalism is a political theory and anarchist school of thought that sees revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a way for workers in capitalist societies to seize control of the economy and hence influence in society. Syndicalism's ultimate goal is to abolish the wage system, which it regards as wage slavery. The labor movement is central to anarcho-syndicalist thought. Anarcho-syndicalism is predicated on the premise that power corrupts and that any hierarchy that cannot be ethically justified must be demolished, reflecting the anarchist ideology from which it gets its major inspiration."
 anarchist_communist:0 "Anarcho-Communism"
 anarchist_communism_desc:0 "Anarcho-communism, also called anarchist communism, is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought that argues for the abolishment of the state, capitalism, wage labor, social hierarchies, and private property. Personal property, as well as jointly owned assets, goods, and services, are respected. It advocates for common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of workers' councils that coordinate production and consumption based on the guiding principle "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs." Some variants of anarcho-communism, such as insurrectional anarchism, are heavily influenced by egoism and radical individualism, claiming that anarcho-communism is the ideal social framework for realizing individual liberty. Anarcho-communism is viewed by most anarcho-communists as a means of reconciling the contradiction between society and the individual."
